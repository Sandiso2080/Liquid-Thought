Umbraco project   
The project is built on Umbraco so what we have done we have uninstalled their theme in order to start everything form scratch on this project we’re using grid for our modules.
We have a global navigation and footer however the navigation is a sticky nav header in our nav we have link which is home and news.
At the back office of Umbraco, we have article color which we can use to select any color that we need and if the color doesn’t exist you can add it without touching the code.
 We have also use bootstrap to do markup and use it classes in order to achieve what we need plus we have custom CSS that we have use to give site some style.
We have two pages Plus one article link page our first page has header carousel slider which took the article post image and being used as header also have read more which redirect us to article link page 
Our second module is a Map since we having a map, we have used the plugin. So, the plugin that we have used is a free plug and its is frame we could have much time to move things a round do so changes but as time goes on, I will continue working on and try to achieve the requirements. Our third module we have content left image right we have heading and read more link 
Our second page is news it has Header below the header we have a breadcrumb and section info text below the breadcrumb.
Our Filter is having All, Director, Latest news, Investment news, group executive so we have used the Article categories to filter each category on the blogs if you select all it will show all blogs or if you select any category, it will select that specific blog.
As we have blogs inside the blogs, we have read more link which redirect us to the other landing page for article.
